# El Discardo 🦹‍♂️

> Your memory's liberator - keeping your tabs "open" while freeing your RAM!

## The Origin Story

While developing [Crawl4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) (your best crawling library 🚀), I became obsessed with browser memory optimization. That's when I engaged more with Chrome's tab discarding feature - a hidden gem that frees up memory by unloading inactive tabs while keeping them visually "open".

But why wait for Chrome to decide? Why not take control? Thus, El Discardo was born - your browser's memory liberator! It helps you keep all those tabs you love "open" while dramatically reducing memory usage. When you need a tab back, it simply reloads - giving you the best of both worlds.

## What El Discardo Does

- **Smart Discarding**: Automatically unloads inactive tabs while keeping them visually present
- **Instant Revival**: Tabs reload only when you need them
- **Memory Freedom**: Keep hundreds of tabs "open" with minimal memory impact
- **Stay Organized**: Search through your tabs, preview content, and chat about them - all while keeping your memory usage low

## Why You Need This

Do you:
- Keep tabs open for days (or weeks)?
- Use your browser as a "read later" list?
- Notice your browser eating up RAM?

El Discardo lets you maintain your tab hoarding habits without the performance penalty!
